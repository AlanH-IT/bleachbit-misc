SUMMARY
HTTP Mail is a module for Drupal 6 to queue external mail and
export it from Drupal by XML RPC.  Then, a client fetches
the mail from Drupal and relays it.  A client in Python
for Google App Engine is provided.


APPLICATION
SourceForge (and probably other web hosts) doesn't allow external
connections.  The module may also be useful for some high
traffic sites.
